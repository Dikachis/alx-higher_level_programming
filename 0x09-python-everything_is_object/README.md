# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Introduction/Objectives
* To know what object is
* To know the difference between a class and an object or instance
* To know the difference between immutable object and mutable object
* To know what a reference is
* To know what an assignment is
* To know what an alias is
* To know how to know if two variables are identical
* To know how to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* To know how to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
* To know what mutable and immutable are
* To know What the built-in mutable types are
* To know what the built-in immutable types are
* To know how Python pass variables to functions

### Resources
* [Objects and values & Aliasing & Cloning lists](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/ch09.html#objects-and-values) || [Mutation](http://composingprograms.com/pages/24-mutable-data.html#sequence-objects) || [Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing](http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/10/python-tuples-immutable-but-potentially-changing.html) etc.
