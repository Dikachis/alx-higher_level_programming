# 0x00. Python - Hello, World
Python programming 
## Introduction/Objective
* To know why Python programming is awesome
* To know who created Python
* To know who is Guido van Rossum
* To know where the name ‘Python’ come from
* To know what is the Zen of Python
* To know how to use the Python interpreter
* To know how to print text and variables using **print**
* To know how to use strings
* To know what are indexing and slicing in Python
* To know what is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with **pycodestyle**

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All files ends with a new line
* Python Scripts: The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* There is a **README.md** file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* There is a **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Codes are checked using the **pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)**
* All files are executable
* Shell Scripts: All are exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
* The first line of all the files are exactly #!/bin/bash
* The only C standard library functions allowed are **malloc**, **free** and **exit**.
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function **_putchar** should be included in your header file called lists.h
* All header files were include guarded
