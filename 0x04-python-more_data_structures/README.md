# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
**About:** To know more of data structures, set and dictionary
## Introduction/Objective
* To know what sets are and how to use them
* To know what the most common methods of set and how to use them
* To know when to use sets versus lists
* To know how to iterate into a set
* To know what dictionaries are and how to use them
* To know when to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
* To know what a key in a dictionary is
* To know how to iterate over a dictionary
* To know what a lambda function is
* To know what the map, reduce and filter functions are

### Resources
* [Data structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) || [Lambda, filter, reduce and map](https://python-course.eu/advanced-python/lambda-filter-reduce-map.php) || [Learn to Program 12 Lambda Map Filter Reduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GAC6KQUPeg)

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All files ends with a new line
* Python Scripts: The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* There is a **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project
* All files are executable
* C script: The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
* All header files were include guarded
